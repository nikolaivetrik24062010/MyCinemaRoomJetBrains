## HOW TO CONTRIBUTE AND HELP ME to LEARN MORE, even add new Features:

Please, when contributing, use only KOTLIN.
If you have suggestions in how to make MAIN.KT cleaner, I would enjoy seeying.
Using different methods, libraries and functions would help me to increase my toolbelt.
If there's any issues that need my attention, please, let me know. I'm eager to learn.
