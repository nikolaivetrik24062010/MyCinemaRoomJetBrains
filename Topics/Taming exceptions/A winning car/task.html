<h2>A winning car</h2>
<p>Imagine that you are choosing a car for a race. The maximum speed of your car <strong>must be</strong> <strong>at least 120 km/h</strong>, and the acceleration time to full speed <strong>must not exceed four seconds</strong>. The acceleration time can't be lower than one second.</p>

<p>If one of these conditions is violated, then an exception must be thrown with the message <code class="java">The race can't be won with this car</code>; otherwise, return <code class="java">I will definitely win!</code>.</p>

<p>Write a function to help you choose a car.</p><br><b>Sample Input:</b><br><pre><code class="language-no-highlight">120<br>3</code></pre><br><b>Sample Output:</b><br><pre><code class="language-no-highlight">I will definitely win!</code></pre><br><br><br><font color="gray">Memory limit: 256 MB</font><br><font color="gray">Time limit: 8 seconds</font><br><br>
